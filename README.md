## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Python 3.6 or higher**: You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Pip**: This is typically included with Python installations.
- **Git**: You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the API repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/smart-contract-vulnerability-api.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd smart-contract-vulnerability-api
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)**:
   It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can create one with the following commands:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   Then, activate the virtual environment:
   - **On Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **On macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required Python packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the API

1. **Start the Flask Application**:
   Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Flask API by running:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Check if the API is Running**:
   By default, the API will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. You can verify that itâ€™s running by visiting this URL in your web browser. You should see a message indicating that the API is up and running.

## Making a Request

1. **Use Postman or CURL**:
   You can use tools like Postman or CURL to send requests to the API.

2. **Send a POST Request**:
   To analyze a smart contract, send a POST request to the `/analyze` endpoint. Below is an example request using CURL:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/analyze \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{
       "contract_code": "pragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract Example {\n    address public owner;\n\n    constructor() {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public {\n        require(_to != address(0), \"Invalid address\");\n        // Transfer logic here\n    }\n}",
       "contract_name": "Example"
   }'
   ```

   Alternatively, if you are using Postman:
   - Set the request type to `POST`.
   - Enter the URL: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/analyze`.
   - Under the "Headers" tab, set `Content-Type` to `application/json`.
   - Under the "Body" tab, select `raw` and enter the JSON data as shown above.

## Understanding the Response

After sending the request, you will receive a response that will look something like this:

```json
{
    "contract_name": "Example",
    "findings": {
        "findings": [
            {
                "cwe": "CWE-190",
                "description": "Integer overflow/underflow vulnerability detected.",
                "mitre": "T1518",
                "suggestion": "Use SafeMath library to prevent overflows and underflows.",
                "vulnerability": "integer_overflow"
            }
        ]
    },
    "features": [3, 1, 1, 2],
    "suggestions": [
        "Suggestion: Use SafeMath library to prevent overflows and underflows."
    ]
}
```

### Response Fields

- **contract_name**: The name of the analyzed smart contract.
- **findings**: An object containing detailed findings about detected vulnerabilities.
  - **cwe**: The Common Weakness Enumeration identifier for the vulnerability.
  - **description**: A brief description of the vulnerability.
  - **mitre**: Related MITRE ATT&CK identifier.
  - **suggestion**: Suggested mitigation for the detected vulnerability.
- **features**: An array of extracted features based on the findings.
- **suggestions**: An array of actionable suggestions to mitigate the detected issues.

## Future Work

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Future updates may include machine learning models to provide more accurate vulnerability predictions and risk assessments.
- **Enhanced Vulnerability Detection**: Ongoing improvements to increase the robustness of vulnerability detection capabilities.
